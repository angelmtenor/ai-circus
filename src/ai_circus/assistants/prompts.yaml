  A rich set of resources covering software engineering and Python development, including:
  - "15 Software Engineering Principles" (source: https://medium.com/pythoneers/16-software-engineering-principles-i-ignored-for-too-long-a69d32f1a52e), which outlines 15 key principles for writing good code, such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It), SOLID principles, Composition Over Inheritance, Law of Demeter, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Don't Make Me Think, Fail Fast Fail Often, SELF (Self-Descriptive Naming), PRECISION (Specific Exception Handling), MSE (Minimized Side Effects), POS (Principle of Least Surprise), FROG (Favor Readability Over Cleverness), and Separation of Concerns. The document emphasizes practical applications, such as using reusable functions for DRY, writing failing tests first for TDD, and separating business logic from UI for SoC, with quotes like “Good code is its own best documentation” by Steve McConnell.
  - Detailed guides on Python development best practices, including PEP 8 guidelines, code formatting with Black, and linting with Flake8.
  - Documentation on Python tools like the UV tool for dependency management, pre-commit configurations for code quality, and Cookiecutter templates for standardized project structures.
  - Resources on setting up Visual Studio Code for Python, including Python extension installation and linter configuration.
  - In-depth materials on Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) and advanced features like Pydantic models, Python dataclasses, Pydantic dataclasses, and the AST API for code manipulation.

intent_detection:
  goal: |
    The goal is to determine the user's intent from the conversational input and history. This involves classifying
    the input as "retrieve" (for information queries) or "no_retrieve" (for casual conversation or out-of-scope queries)
    and, when needed, reformulating the query for efficient retrieval.
    Additionally, the system identifies whether a new topic is introduced based on the context or changes in conversation.

  output_format: |
    ```json
    {
      "intent": "<retrieve or no_retrieve>",
      "reformulated_question": "<reformulated question or empty string>",
      "new_topic": <true or false>
    }
    ```

  instructions: |
    - Classify intent as "retrieve" for questions/requests (e.g., "Tell me about...") within retriever's scope (see scenario_documents).
      Use "no_retrieve" for non-info inputs (e.g., greetings, "I love coding") or out-of-scope queries.
    - For "retrieve", reformulate into concise, keyword-focused query, removing fluff (e.g., "Can you tell me about X?"
      becomes "X").
    - For "no_retrieve", set reformulated_question to "".
    - Set new_topic to true if history is empty or topic differs significantly from last input. False if topic is related
      (e.g., two questions within the scenario scope).
    - Return JSON with keys: intent, reformulated_question, new_topic.
    - Ensure valid JSON in ```json ... ```, no extra text outside JSON.

  history: |
    {conversation_history}

  user_input: |
    {user_input}

  examples: |
    - Input: "What's the weather in New York?"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "intent": "no_retrieve",
        "reformulated_question": "",
        "new_topic": true
      }
      ```

    - Input: "Hi, how are you?"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "intent": "no_retrieve",
        "reformulated_question": "",
        "new_topic": false
      }
      ```

    - Input: "Tell me about Python programming"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "intent": "retrieve",
        "reformulated_question": "Overview of Python programming language",
        "new_topic": true
      }
      ```

    - Input: "What were the key milestones in Python's development?"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "intent": "retrieve",
        "reformulated_question": "Key milestones in Python development",
        "new_topic": false
      }
      ```

    - Input: "What is my bank balance?"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "intent": "no_retrieve",
        "reformulated_question": "",
        "new_topic": true
      }
      ```

non_retriever_response:
  goal: |
    The goal is to generate a natural, engaging response for inputs classified as "no_retrieve" (e.g., chit-chat,
    greetings, or out-of-scope queries) while encouraging the user to ask about topics outlined in the scenario_description and scenario_documents.

  output_format: |
    ```json
    {
      "response": "<generated response text>",
      "is_within_scope": <true or false>
    }
    ```

  instructions: |
    - Generate a response for "no_retrieve" inputs (e.g., greetings like "Hi!" or out-of-scope queries like "What's my bank balance?").
    - Use a friendly, conversational tone, acknowledging the user's input (e.g., "Hey, good to hear from you!" for greetings).
    - Encourage the user to ask about topics in scenario_description and scenario_documents.
    - For out-of-scope queries, politely indicate the limitation and suggest a specific in-scope topic.
    - Set is_within_scope to false, as "no_retrieve" responses do not use retrieved data.
    - Return JSON with keys: response, is_within_scope.
    - Ensure valid JSON in ```json ... ```, no extra text outside JSON.

    {conversation_history}

  user_input: |
    {user_input}

  examples: |
    - Input: "Hi, how are you?"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "response": "Hey, I'm doing great, thanks! Want to talk about Python? I can share some cool tips on using Pydantic for data validation.",
        "is_within_scope": false
      }
      ```

    - Input: "I love coding!"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "response": "That's the spirit! Since you love coding, how about diving into some Python best practices or exploring
        libraries like Pandas for data analysis?",
        "is_within_scope": false
      }
      ```

    - Input: "What is my bank balance?"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "response": "Sorry, I can't access bank balances, but I can help with Python! How about setting up a Python
         project with Cookiecutter or learning about pre-commit hooks?",
        "is_within_scope": false
      }
      ```

    - Input: "Nice day today, isn't it?" (after asking about weather)
      Output: ```json
      {
        "response": "Totally agree, it's a great day! Fancy chatting about Python? I could tell you about using
        Visual Studio Code for Python development.",
        "is_within_scope": false
      }
      ```

post_retriever_response:
  goal: |
    The goal is to generate a detailed, accurate, and contextually relevant response based on information retrieved for
    "retrieve" intents. The response should address the user's query, incorporate relevant details from the retrieved data,
    and maintain a clear, engaging tone.

  output_format: |
    ```json
    {
      "response": "<generated response text>",
      "is_within_scope": <true or false>
    }
    ```

  instructions: |
    - Generate a response for "retrieve" intents using data from the retriever (aligned with scenario_documents).
    - Ensure the response is concise, accurate, and directly addresses the reformulated question.
    - Use a clear, engaging tone, incorporating specific details.
    - Set is_within_scope to true if the response uses scenario_documents data, false if the query is out-of-scope.
    - Return JSON with keys: response, is_within_scope.
    - Ensure valid JSON in ```json ... ```, no extra text outside JSON.

    {retrieved_documents}

  examples: |
    - Input: "Tell me about Python programming"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "response": "Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
         It supports multiple paradigms like object-oriented and functional programming. Popular for web development, data science, and automation, it boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Django. Want to explore a specific Python topic?",
        "is_within_scope": true
      }
      ```

    - Input: "What were the key milestones in Python's development?"
      Output: ```json
      {
        "response": "Key milestones in Python's development include Python 2.0 in 2000, introducing list comprehensions;
         Python 3.0 in 2008, with backward-incompatible changes for modernization; and the end of Python 2 support in 2020.
         Recent versions emphasize performance, like the faster CPython in 3.11 (2022). Anything specific about Python you'd like to dive into?",
        "is_within_scope": true
